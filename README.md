HeadUnit Desktop is a Qt based free and open source software that is intended to be run on computers built into cars. This software is currently under active development and lot of the features are experimental. As of now there are two main features: 

 - Media player with a media library and media scanner
 - Android Auto™ client
 - DAB radio

Proposed features:

 - FM Radio
 - CAN bus sniffer (depending on how much control different modules of the car allow and how much information, such as A/C steering wheel controls, different gauges and sensor data) with a customizable profile for each car.

The GUI for some of the proposed features is already there. For screenshots of the current state of the GUI [go to the screenshots page.](http://headunit.viktorgino.me/SCREENSHOTS)
